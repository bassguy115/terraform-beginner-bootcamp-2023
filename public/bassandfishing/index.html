    <h1>Fishing for Bass and Fishing in general is a great challenge!!</h1>
    <p>Bass fishing is a popular and exciting form of angling. It involves pursuing various species of bass, such as largemouth bass and smallmouth bass, found in both freshwater lakes and rivers. Anglers use a variety of lures and techniques to catch these elusive and powerful fish. Whether you're a seasoned angler or a novice, bass fishing offers a thrilling and rewarding experience in the world of fishing.
    These are all Smallmouth Bass from the Susquehanna River in Maryland. The top left photo shows its "tiger striping" in this species. Some of the areas I have fished are linked.

        <h1>This is a form of bass, a Rock Bass.</h1>
        <p>The Rock bass is a member of the Sunfish family (Centrarchidae). This big-mouthed sunfish is an ambush predator that feeds on a wide variety of minnows and aquatic insects.
            I've only caught this one. The record in my state is 1.0lb from 1997. This fish is probaby 6oz.
